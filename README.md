# PiFi It's time to give the royal flush to spending hours working on setting up your Raspberry Pi into your own portable Travel Router. This project is intended to do just that by attempting to make it possible to use your Pi as a WiFi router,  This is much more mobile friendly and also insanely amazing because it's like a sucker punch to the big name routers. Forget paying 500$ for a battery pack enabled travel router with high end *See note below* features as this project can be used to do what the high end routers*See note below* do all within a decent cost of around 45$ one time fee* *See note below*.  If you have Straight Talk you can pare this with MobileStream and change this projects file to your respective adapter info to get Unlimited mobile hotspot. 
# * 45$ fee does not include monthly fees required for active internet service which are subscriptions the end user pays for with providers such as AT&T, Comcast, Straight Talk, Charter etc. This fee is strictly shown for reference purposes for the average starting cost of the Raspberry Pi Starter Kit listed on Amazon.
# * High End Routers refer to optional select packages that are installable programs that are available through the Raspberry Pi Website directly or through the command line using the apt-get language.  
# THIS PROJECT IS AN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT AND IS ONLY FOR WHITE HAT USE ONLY. WE (THE DEVELOPERS) ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE END USERS ACTIONS OR ANY COMPLICATIONS THAT MAY ARISE.
